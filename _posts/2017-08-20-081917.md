"Hello Kate,  
After along day away from home, I got back hot (it is summer, and a scorching one at that, here in Sydney), tired, and ready for a bit of pampering. And there it was a small, soft parcel - yay! I knew it had to be from you - there was nothing else I was expecting. Here's what I loved:  
1\. Compact - exactly what I want for taking away on travels of any kind. You really don't want half your luggage taken up with a dressing gown and this packs into nothing.  
2\. On unpacking, through the clear plastic packaging, I was delighted to see a beautiful riot of colour and design. My gown is daffodils and dogwood - so gorgeous and cheerful. Fabulous!  
3\. Taking the gown out of the plastic - joy! A beautiful, fine, and luxurious cotton, perfect for our hot, sticky summers. Thank you gods above - I can now chuck out my dreadful cotton, but seriously stifling, boring, hospital-grade ill-fitting waffle-weave mood spoiler.  
4\. Truly the most comfortable, well-fitted, true-to-size garment I can recall purchasing in recent history. First - your wrap-around styling/fit is the first I've ever had that actually does fit! I feel comfortable - it doesn't gape and expose anything I don't willingly want to expose. It's elegantly long enough that I can bend over without fear of embarrassment! It's divinely flattering - dare I say it, I look alluringly willowy in your gorgeous gown:)  
In short - it's fabulous! I love it! Were it not for the extravagance, I'd get one in each and every print and wear little else! Well done you and thanks Etsy for bringing you to me."
